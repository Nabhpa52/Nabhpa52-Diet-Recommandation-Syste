# 🍽️ Machine Learning-Based Diet Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Diet Recommendation System** is a Machine Learning project designed to provide **personalized diet suggestions** based on user attributes such as:
- Height
- Weight
- Age
- Gender
- Activity level
- Medical history (e.g., blood pressure, diabetes)

The system leverages **machine learning models** trained on Indian meal datasets to suggest healthy and customized diet plans.
